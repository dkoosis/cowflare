# Post-Deployment Verification Checklist

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Update your `src/index.ts`** with MCP-compliant implementation ✅
2. **Update your `src/debug-logger.ts`** with improved dashboard ✅
3. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers** ✅
4. **Clear any cached connections in Claude.ai**

## 🧪 Verification Tests

### 1. Compliance Test Script
```bash
./mcp-compliance-test.sh
```
- [x] All tests should pass ✅
- [x] Protected Resource Metadata endpoint working
- [x] WWW-Authenticate headers correct
- [x] CORS configured properly

### 2. Debug Dashboard
Visit `https://your-server.com/debug`
- [x] Chronological view working
- [x] Export feature functional
- [x] Protocol validator available

### 3. Manual Endpoint Tests
- [x] `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` returns JSON
- [x] `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` returns JSON
- [x] `/mcp` returns 401 with proper headers

## 🔌 Claude.ai Integration Test

### Current Status: ❌ Not Connecting

**What Works:**
- [x] OAuth flow completes successfully
- [x] Token is stored correctly
- [x] All endpoints responding correctly

**What Doesn't Work:**
- [ ] Claude.ai shows "Connected" status
- [ ] No MCP discovery attempts after OAuth
- [ ] No requests to protected resource metadata

### Protocol Validator Results
- OAuth Phase: 100% (3/3 required steps)
- MCP Phase: 0% (0/4 expected steps)
- Overall: 43% compliance

## 🔍 Debugging Next Steps

### 1. Client-Side Investigation
- [ ] Open browser dev tools
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Monitor network tab
- [ ] Look for failed requests

### 2. Export Debug Logs
- [ ] Click "Export for Debugging" in dashboard
- [ ] Note the "EXPECTED BUT MISSING" section
- [ ] Share full export for analysis

### 3. Compare with Working Implementation
- [ ] Find known working MCP server
- [ ] Compare response formats
- [ ] Check for additional fields

### 4. Test with Official Tools
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
- [ ] Verify our server works with inspector
- [ ] Compare with Claude.ai behavior

## 📊 What We've Learned

1. **Spec compliance isn't enough** - Server passes all tests but connection fails
2. **Silent failures are common** - No error messages from Claude.ai
3. **Debug tools are essential** - Our validator shows exactly where flow stops

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **No activity after token exchange**
   - Claude.ai gets OAuth token successfully
   - Makes no further requests
   - Suggests client-side issue or missing signal

2. **Protocol validator shows incomplete flow**
   - OAuth steps: ✅✅✅
   - MCP discovery steps: ❌❌❌❌

## 📝 Status Summary

**Server Implementation**: ✅ Complete and spec-compliant
**Debug Tools**: ✅ Advanced dashboard with validation
**OAuth Flow**: ✅ Working correctly
**MCP Discovery**: ❌ Not attempted by Claude.ai
**Overall Connection**: ❌ Not working

The server is ready and compliant. The issue appears to be in triggering Claude.ai to proceed with MCP discovery after OAuth completion.
