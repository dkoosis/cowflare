# Quality-First Development Roadmap

## Philosophy
Each step must be rock-solid before proceeding. No technical debt. No shortcuts.

## Phase 1: Establish Baseline âœ“
- [x] Cloudflare hello world MCP server running
- [x] OAuth flow working with mock provider
- [x] Single `add` tool implemented
- [x] Basic HTTP endpoints responding

## Phase 2: Testing Foundation (CURRENT)
- [ ] Manual testing documented and verified
- [ ] Integration tests for OAuth flow
- [ ] MCP protocol tests for `add` tool
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline established

## Phase 3: Incremental Enhancement
Only after Phase 2 is complete:
- [ ] Add `whoami` tool (tests first)
- [ ] Add `increment` tool (tests first)
- [ ] Add state persistence (tests first)
- [ ] Add real OAuth provider (tests first)

## Phase 4: Production Features
Only after Phase 3 is stable:
- [ ] RTM integration
- [ ] Advanced MCP features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening

## Quality Gates
Before moving to next phase:
1. All tests passing
2. Documentation current
3. No known bugs
4. Code reviewed
5. STATE.yaml updated

## Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Adding features before tests
- Skipping error handling
- Ignoring flaky tests
- Accumulating TODOs
- Guessing at APIs
