# ADR-0012: Technology Stack for MCP Server Development

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context

### Project Overview
We are developing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to provide AI assistants with access to external systems and data sources. The initial implementations target:

1. **Ticketing System Integration**: Serving nonprofit organizations with price sensitivity ($500-$2500/month budget), experiencing spikey usage patterns around show performances
2. **Remember The Milk (RTM) Integration**: Community-focused project intended for wide availability at cost, potentially serving variable user loads

### Key Requirements
- **Enterprise/SMB Grade Quality**: High reliability, maintainability, security
- **Solo Development & Maintenance**: Must be manageable by a single developer
- **Configurable & Performant**: Adaptable to different customer needs
- **Cost-Effective Scaling**: Handle variable/spikey loads without excessive costs
- **Inter-conversation Memory**: Maintain user context between MCP sessions
- **Global Accessibility**: Serve users across different geographic regions

### Technical Constraints
- Scale complexity not worth optimizing for initially
- Preference for straightforward, proven technologies
- Need for persistent state management (user sessions, preferences, auth tokens)
- API integration patterns (HTTP requests, JSON processing, authentication)

## Decision

**Selected: TypeScript + Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects**

### Core Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (V8 isolates, global edge deployment)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **State Management**: Durable Objects for inter-conversation memory
- **Secrets Management**: Cloudflare Workers Secrets
- **Configuration**: Environment variables + Workers configuration
- **Deployment**: Wrangler CLI with git-based deployments

## Rationale

### Primary Factors
1. **Cost Model Alignment**: Pay-per-request pricing perfectly matches spikey nonprofit usage patterns and cost-conscious RTM project goals
2. **Operational Simplicity**: Zero infrastructure management, instant global deployment via CLI
3. **Performance**: Sub-10ms cold starts globally distributed, ideal for real-time MCP interactions
4. **State Management**: Durable Objects provide exactly the inter-conversation memory capabilities needed
5. **Development Velocity**: Instant deployment and iteration cycles

### Business Case
- **Ticketing System**: Variable costs scale with actual usage during show seasons, keeping nonprofits within budget
- **RTM Integration**: Near-zero baseline costs enable sustainable "at-cost" community offering
- **Global Distribution**: Automatic edge deployment ensures good performance regardless of user location

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components
```
MCP Server
├── Workers (Request Handling)
│   ├── Authentication & routing
│   ├── API integration logic
│   └── Response formatting
├── Durable Objects (State Management)
│   ├── User session persistence
│   ├── Preferences & configuration
│   └── Authentication token storage
└── Secrets (Configuration)
    ├── API keys & credentials
    ├── Database connections
    └── Encryption keys
```

### Data Flow
1. **MCP Request** → Worker (global edge)
2. **State Retrieval** → Durable Object (user-scoped)
3. **External API Calls** → Third-party services
4. **State Update** → Durable Object persistence
5. **Response** → MCP client

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Cost Predictability**: Usage-based pricing eliminates surprise bills during low-activity periods
- **Global Performance**: Automatic edge distribution without configuration
- **Zero Operational Overhead**: No servers, containers, or databases to manage
- **Instant Deployment**: Changes live globally within seconds
- **Built-in Scaling**: Automatic handling of traffic spikes
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, integrated debugging, comprehensive CLI

### Negative
- **Platform Lock-in**: Cloudflare-specific APIs and deployment model
- **Runtime Constraints**: 10-second execution limit, memory restrictions
- **Ecosystem Quality**: JavaScript/TypeScript dependency management challenges
- **Debugging Limitations**: Less sophisticated tooling compared to traditional environments

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Lock-in**: Abstract external integrations behind interfaces for potential future migration
- **Runtime Limits**: Design for stateless, event-driven patterns; use Durable Objects for persistence
- **Ecosystem**: Implement strict dependency management practices (see ADR-002)
- **Debugging**: Invest in comprehensive logging and structured error handling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Local development with hot reload
wrangler dev

# TypeScript checking
npx tsc --noEmit --watch

# Deployment
wrangler deploy
```

### Environment Management
- **Development**: Local wrangler environment with test secrets
- **Staging**: Dedicated Cloudflare environment for integration testing
- **Production**: Multi-region deployment with production secrets

### State Management Pattern
- **User-scoped Durable Objects**: One DO instance per user for session data
- **Configuration Objects**: Tenant-specific settings and preferences
- **Cache Objects**: Shared data and API response caching

## Success Metrics

### Achieved Targets
- **Development Velocity**: First MCP server deployed within 2 weeks
- **Cost Efficiency**: <5% of revenue spent on infrastructure
- **Performance**: P95 response times <50ms globally
- **Reliability**: >99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Operational Overhead**: <2 hours/week maintenance

### Quality Indicators
- Zero security incidents
- <1% error rate across all endpoints
- Sub-second deployment times
- 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Future Considerations

### Scaling Boundaries
- **10K+ concurrent users**: May need Durable Object optimization
- **Complex workflows**: Consider Workers + external services hybrid
- **Enterprise features**: Evaluate additional Cloudflare services (R2, D1, Queues)

### Technology Evolution
- **MCP Protocol Changes**: Platform flexibility supports rapid protocol iteration
- **Cloudflare Platform**: Strong roadmap alignment with edge computing trends
- **Team Growth**: TypeScript/Workers skills transferable to other developers
