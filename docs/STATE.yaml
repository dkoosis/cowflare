# STATE.yaml - Machine-optimized session context
# Updated: 2025-01-18 - New Session

## Current State
status: "development"
phase: "testing_and_verification"
approach: "mock_oauth_with_rtm_ready"

## Architecture Decisions
transport:
  - SSE support for backward compatibility
  - Streamable HTTP for future-proofing
  - Single Worker handling both transports
auth:
  - Mock OAuth provider initially
  - Structure ready for Cloudflare RTM integration
  - Token-based session management

## Implementation Plan
1. Base structure from remote-mcp-server template
2. Mock OAuth handler (replace GitHub handler)
3. RTM integration points identified
4. Test harness for local development

## Known Issues
- None yet (fresh start)

## Session Goals
- [x] Set up vitest test infrastructure
- [ ] Test OAuth flow with MCP inspector
- [ ] Verify tool execution with authentication
- [ ] Test session persistence
- [ ] Document RTM integration requirements
- [ ] Prepare for RTM handler implementation

## Session Results
# Previous session:
# - Created complete project structure from remote-mcp-server template
# - Implemented MockAuthHandler with visual OAuth flow
# - Set up dual transport support (SSE + Streamable HTTP)
# - Added three test tools: add, whoami, increment
# - Configured for easy RTM integration (handler swap)
# Current session:
- Created vitest configuration with Cloudflare Workers pool
- Wrote oauth.test.ts following testing standards
- Wrote mcp-tools.test.ts with schema validation
- Tests ready to run after npm install

## Discovery
- Found existing workers in Cloudflare account:
  - rtm-mcp-server (modified 2025-07-16)
  - rtm-auth-page (modified 2025-06-20)
- These may contain RTM integration code to reference

## Issues Resolved
- Removed non-existent @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider dependency
- Implemented simple OAuth flow with Hono directly
- Fixed wrangler KV namespace command syntax
- Downgraded vitest to compatible version
