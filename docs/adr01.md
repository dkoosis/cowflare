ADR-001: Platform and Deployment Strategy
Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-06-21
Context
The Cowflare project requires a runtime environment for a remote MCP server that is scalable, performant with low global latency, and easy to manage and deploy. The server needs to execute TypeScript code and integrate with a persistent data store for managing authentication state.

Decision
We will use Cloudflare Workers as the runtime platform for the MCP server. This decision leverages a serverless architecture, running code on Cloudflare's edge network. The entire development and deployment lifecycle will be managed using the Wrangler CLI, as configured in the project's package.json and wrangler.toml files.

Consequences
Positive:
Global Scalability & Low Latency: The application is deployed to Cloudflare's global network, ensuring fast response times for users anywhere.
Zero-Maintenance Infrastructure: The serverless model eliminates the need to manage servers, containers, or other traditional infrastructure.
Integrated Toolchain: The Wrangler CLI provides a robust and well-documented tool for local development, testing, and deployment, simplifying the development workflow.
Native Integration: Seamlessly integrates with other Cloudflare services, such as the KV store used for authentication state.
Negative:
Platform-Specific Code: The codebase relies on Cloudflare-specific APIs and runtime environment, which could complicate a future migration to another platform.
Local Simulation: While wrangler dev provides excellent local simulation, it may not perfectly replicate all aspects of the production Edge environment, requiring testing on deployed environments.
Alternatives Considered
Container-Based Deployment (e.g., Docker on Cloud Run/Fargate): Offers more control over the runtime environment but introduces significant overhead in building, managing, and scaling container images.
Traditional Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions): Viable alternatives, but Cloudflare Workers provides a unique advantage by running on a global edge network, which is ideal for a low-latency API server.
