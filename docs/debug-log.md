Debug Log - RTM MCP Integration
üö® CODING ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS
CRITICAL RULES

RTFM: NEVER guess at MCP protocol, Cloudflare APIs, or OAuth specs
Claude.ai is CORRECT: The client implements the protocol correctly
MCP uses STREAMING HTTP: NOT SSE, NOT WebSockets - JSONRPC over HTTP streaming

üìä CURRENT STATE: Connection Closes Immediately
‚úÖ WORKING (Don't Touch)

OAuth flow completes perfectly
/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource returns correct metadata
/mcp returns proper 401 + WWW-Authenticate header
CORS headers configured correctly
Token storage in KV works

‚ùå BROKEN

/mcp endpoint closes connection immediately after auth validation
Chrome console: MCP error -32000: Connection closed

üéØ ROOT CAUSE
Our /mcp endpoint returns a standard HTTP response and closes. MCP requires a persistent streaming HTTP connection for JSONRPC message exchange.
üîß REQUIRED FIX
Find and update the /mcp endpoint implementation:
typescript// WRONG - Current implementation probably looks like:
app.get('/mcp', authMiddleware, async (c) => {
  // Some validation...
  return c.json({ success: true }); // This closes immediately!
});

// CORRECT - Must implement streaming:
app.get('/mcp', authMiddleware, async (c) => {
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      // 1. Send initial JSONRPC response
      controller.enqueue(JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        method: "connection/ready",
        params: {}
      }) + '\n');
      
      // 2. Set up request body reader for incoming JSONRPC
      const reader = c.req.body?.getReader();
      
      // 3. Handle bidirectional JSONRPC communication
      // 4. Keep connection alive
    }
  });
  
  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'
    }
  });
});
üìù IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

Locate current /mcp implementation

Check src/index.ts or wherever routes are defined
Look for the authenticated /mcp endpoint


Check if using McpServer from SDK

If yes: Need to connect it to streaming transport
If no: Need to implement JSONRPC handling


Key requirements:

Must NOT close connection after auth
Must handle streaming JSONRPC messages
Must integrate with existing RtmMCP Durable Object



üõ†Ô∏è DEBUG TOOLS TO USE

ProtocolLogger - Will show the exact request/response
Chrome DevTools - Network tab to see if connection stays open
Debug Dashboard - Check for new events after connection attempt

‚ùì QUESTIONS TO ANSWER FIRST

Where is the current /mcp endpoint defined?
Is it already using the MCP SDK's server?
How is it currently handling the authenticated request?

üö´ DON'T WASTE TIME ON

‚ùå OAuth flow (working perfectly)
‚ùå Discovery endpoints (all correct)
‚ùå CORS configuration (already fixed)
‚ùå Token validation (working)
‚ùå Any theory that Claude.ai is wrong


Next Action: Find the current /mcp endpoint implementation and show how it's handling authenticated requests. The fix is to convert it from a close-on-response to a streaming connection.
