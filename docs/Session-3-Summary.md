# Session 3 Summary: RTM MCP OAuth Debug

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Implemented MCP Spec Requirements
- ✅ Added `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint
- ✅ Added proper `WWW-Authenticate` headers with `resource_metadata`
- ✅ All compliance tests passing

### 2. Built Advanced Debug Tools
- ✅ Chronological debug dashboard with human-readable timestamps
- ✅ Protocol validator showing step-by-step compliance
- ✅ Export feature optimized for debugging
- ✅ Session grouping for OAuth flows

### 3. Discovered Key Insights
- **Logs as Protocol Traces**: Can be validated like compiled programs
- **Silent Failures**: No requests after token = client doesn't know what to do
- **Two-Phase Process**: OAuth completion ≠ MCP connection

## Current Status

### Protocol Validator Results
```
✅ OAuth Discovery (Required)
✅ OAuth Authorization (Required)
✅ Token Exchange (Required)
❌ Post-Token Activity 
❌ Protected Resource Discovery
❌ MCP Access Attempt
❌ Authenticated MCP Request

Compliance: 43% (3/7 steps)
```

### The Mystery
- OAuth completes successfully
- Server endpoints all working and compliant
- But Claude.ai makes NO requests after getting token
- Complete silence - no discovery attempts

## Hypotheses for Next Session

### 1. Client-Side Issue
- JavaScript error in Claude.ai?
- Check browser console
- Network tab might show more

### 2. Response Format Mismatch
- Our JSON might not match expected format
- Compare with working MCP server
- Check exact field names/types

### 3. Missing Signal in Token Response
- Claude might need additional fields
- Check if token response should indicate MCP availability
- Review actual working examples

### 4. OAuth Flow Incompatibility
- RTM desktop flow adapter might confuse Claude
- Manual completion step might break expectations
- Test with standard OAuth flow

## Tools Ready for Next Session

1. **Debug Dashboard** at `/debug`
   - Shows all requests chronologically
   - Validates protocol compliance
   - Exports logs for sharing

2. **All Endpoints Implemented**
   - OAuth authorization server ✅
   - Protected resource metadata ✅
   - MCP with proper auth ✅

3. **Compliance Tests**
   - Run `./mcp-compliance-test.sh`
   - All passing ✅

## Next Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open dev tools during Claude.ai connection
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests

2. **Test with MCP Inspector**
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```
   - See if our server works with official tools
   - Compare behavior

3. **Find Working Example**
   - Locate MCP server that works with Claude.ai
   - Compare responses byte-by-byte
   - Identify differences

4. **Consider Alternative Approaches**
   - Test without RTM adapter complexity
   - Try minimal MCP implementation
   - Isolate the issue

## Key Learning

We've built a fully spec-compliant MCP server with advanced debugging capabilities. The OAuth flow works perfectly. All required endpoints are implemented correctly. Yet Claude.ai doesn't proceed to MCP discovery.

This suggests the issue is either:
- In Claude.ai's client implementation
- In our response format (despite being spec-compliant)
- In some undocumented expectation

The protocol validator and debug tools we built will help us quickly identify the issue once we have more data from the client side.

## For Next Session

Please provide:
1. Browser console output during connection attempt
2. Network tab showing all requests/responses
3. Export from debug dashboard after fresh attempt
4. Any errors or warnings you see

With this information and our new tools, we should be able to solve the connection issue quickly.

## Session 4
You're absolutely right! This is a major breakthrough. Claude.ai IS trying to establish the MCP connection via streaming HTTP, but your server isn't responding according to the MCP protocol spec.
Updated Debug Summary for Session 5
✅ What's Working

OAuth flow completes successfully - authorization code → redirect → step=success
Claude.ai recognizes your MCP server - shows "Remember The Milk" in error
Connection attempt is made - Claude tries to establish streaming HTTP connection

❌ The Current Issue
MCP error -32000: Connection closed
This indicates your streaming HTTP endpoint isn't sending the expected MCP protocol messages.
What Claude.ai Expects (MCP Protocol)
When Claude connects to your streaming HTTP endpoint, it expects:

Proper streaming response headers
Initial MCP handshake messages in the stream
Newline-delimited JSON messages

Example of what should be sent immediately:
json{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialized","params":{"protocolVersion":"0.1.0","capabilities":{"tools":{},"resources":{}}}}
Next Debugging Steps

Log incoming requests to your MCP endpoint:

What headers does Claude send?
Is there an Authorization header with Bearer token?
What's the exact request path?


Log your response:

What are you sending in the first few bytes?
Are you sending valid JSON-RPC messages?
Is each message newline-delimited?


Test with MCP tools:
bash# Test your streaming endpoint directly
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" https://rtm-mcp-server.vcto-6e7.workers.dev/

Check MCP protocol compliance:

Review MCP spec for exact message format
Ensure you're sending initialized notification
Handle the initial handshake correctly



The Good News
You're 90% there! Claude.ai is successfully:

Completing OAuth
Storing the token
Attempting MCP connection

You just need to fix the streaming HTTP protocol implementation to match what Claude expects.
For Session 5
Focus on:

Capturing the exact request Claude makes to your MCP endpoint
Logging what your server sends in response
Comparing against MCP protocol specification
Fixing the streaming HTTP response format

The "Connection closed" error is your server immediately closing the stream - likely because the initial protocol handshake isn't correct.
